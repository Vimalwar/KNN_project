Given predictive features like education, employment status , marital status etc., the objective is to predict, if the salary is greater than 50 k or not. In target column, 1 is denoted for salary greater than 50 k and 0 is denoted for salary lesser than 50k. In the given data, we have both categorical features and numerical feature. Our task is to build a classifier ,i.e., a mathematical model and train its parameters through the given labelled training data set and thereby producing an infered function to a new test point to the most suitable discrete class. Here I had used KNN Machine Learning Algorithm.
